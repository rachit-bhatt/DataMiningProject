## Introduction
Our NBA dataset focuses on player and team statistics, game outcomes, and more. We’ll dive into the data, clean it, and extract meaningful features for analysis. Let’s explore the world of NBA data together!

## Data Sources
We’ve collected data from various sources, including:

**NBA Stats Website:** Scraped raw datasets for players, teams, and games.

**Kaggle Datasets:** Curated datasets spanning multiple NBA seasons.

## Data Preprocessing
Before we can analyze the data, we’ll perform essential preprocessing steps:

**Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**Feature Engineering:** Create new features based on existing ones.

**Transformation:** Normalize or scale relevant attributes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our EDA will involve:

**Visualizations:** Uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies.

**Descriptive Statistics:** Summarize key metrics.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Investigate relationships between variables.

## Model Building
We’ll explore predictive models for:

**Game Outcomes:** Can we predict which team will win based on historical data?

**Player Performance:** How well can we forecast individual player stats?

## Evaluation
We’ll evaluate our models using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.
